## 1. **What is your goal with respect to your research project to get accomplished this week?**

This week I want to get my visualizations polished and published on my RPubs. 

## 2. **What is the overall status of your research repo? Is it will organized with a clear Readme file? Are file names and directory clear? Would your classmates be able to understand what the code in your files is designed to do?**

Overall status is probably 70% there, in terms of organization and completeness. I am trying to put README files in each directory to explain what files are in each directory and the high-level organization and description of the data and goal.Yes, I think classmates would be able to undersatnd the code in the files and what it is doing.

## 3. **Go to one of your classmates rpubs link (see issues). What are three things you think are neat? What are two things that are really not that clear to you?**

I like that Olivia's RPubs page has code-chunks in a obvious, different background color. 
I also like Celeste's heatmap (and all her recent visualizations). Jordan's Overview of her project and a highlight of workflow code is great organization.

What's not clear to me: 
I'm still not sure what's the better format: one long workflow start to end, or broken up into smaller steps. How big should each step be? It's a preference thing but can't decide yet for myself.
