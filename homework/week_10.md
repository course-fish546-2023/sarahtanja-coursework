# Week 10 Questions

Sarah Tanja

## 1. **Looking back on the quarter what are two things you were not expecting to learn but did, glad you did, and how would you implement this knowledge beyond this class?**

One thing I was not expecting to learn was how to use `Chatgpt` while coding to explain lines of code, especially code written by someone else, that you are working to modify for your own project purposes. Though initial answers aren't always right, a little probing and trial and error gets me to the correct code and syntax faster than sifting through stack overflow posts. I will continue to use `Chatgpt` while coding to make the inevitable error code searches faster.

Another unexpected, but appreciated, thing that I learned during this course was how to use `quarto`. I like the additional builtin markdown formatting that can be accomplished in documents with `quarto`, and `quarto revealjs` for presentations. I actually transitioned my open lab notebook from a GitHub pages site built with `jekyll` to a `quarto` site (still deployed via GitHub pages), which allows better integration with code and math blocks, etc. than pure markdown. It also facilitates margin referencing, which I want to get in the habit of doing.

## 2. **Rank the following from 1-5, with 1 being your best friend and 5 being your enemy (raven, rstudio, knitr, bash, github)**

1.  rstudio
2.  github
3.  knitr
4.  bash
5.  raven

## 3. **As part of your research project you must have learned something beyond methods. What is the most important biological finding from your work to date?** Assuming you follow this line of research what is your long term goal of what you expect to learn about biology, ecology, or the environment?

This question is hard for me, because I borrowed sequence data from another project, I didn't have my own exciting findings to look at during this course. I am very excited to get my sequences and pass them through the pipeline I built over this quarter... but findings are still on the horizon. In regards to the borrowed dataset from A. Huffmyer's Early Life History Energetics study and the NCBI BioProject [PRJNA900235](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA900235), I compared 4 *Montipora capitata* rice coral embryos to 4 recruits and saw a very strong signal of differentially expressed genes. I'm currently working on getting meaningful visualizations of gene function for the top 20 out of 54,384 differentially expressed genes, 20,427 of which are actually annotated with gene ontology terms.
