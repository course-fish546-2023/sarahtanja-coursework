a)  **An R Markdown file is plain text file that contains what 3 important types of content?**

1.  An (optional) YAML header surrounded by `--- .`
2.  Chunks of `R code` surrounded by \`\`\` .
3.  Text mixed with simple text formatting like \# headings, **bold**, and *italics*.


b)  **What is a chunk and how do you add them? of the many chunk options which one do you think you will use the most and why? How is inline code different than code chunks?**

A chunk is a mini coding window. You can add them to RMarkdown documents via 1. keyboard shortcut (for example `Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + i` inserts an `R` code chunk), 2. the "insert" button in the editor toolbar, 3. manually typing \`\`\`{r} \`\`\` (or replace `r` with `bash` for a different code language) to render:

```{r}
```

```{bash}
```

c)  **What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?**

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

The points are not blue because inside the aesthetics function aes(), you are mapping an aesthetic characteristic of a graph (like the x axis, the y axis, the size, shape, and color of the points) to a **variable** in the data frame... "blue" is not a variable in the `mpg` data frame. If you want the points to be blue, you add that code outside of the aes() function, but wrapped inside the mapping() function as below:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```


d)  **Of the many things we have done in class the past two weeks, what is one aspect you would like to revisit and spend more time on?**
RNAseq. We used kallisto to
