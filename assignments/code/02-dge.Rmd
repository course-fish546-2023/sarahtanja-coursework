# Differential Gene Expression

<https://sr320.github.io/course-fish546-2023/assignments/02-DGE.html>

For this assignment you will be taking RNA-seq data, and running a common differential gene expression analysis, without the use of a reference genome. The end product will be a plot and table of deferentially expressed genes.

> Kallisto is a pseudo-aligner, it does not need a genome to align to! it uses the sequences in the dataset to create it's own 'reference'

## Advance prep: Setup git hooks to automatically gitignore files \>100MB

In this assignment we're dealing with large files that will end up in the ../data and ../output directories. To prevent those large files from clogging up our ability to 'git push', we can use built-in hooks to automatically ignore files larger than 100 MB (no matter the directory or file name!). Here are the steps to follow:

-   Create a new text file in the .git/hooks/ directory of your repository called pre-commit. *Select the `More` tab with the gear icon under the RStudio Files navigator bar and select 'show hidden files' to see the .git folder*.

-   Add the following code to the pre-commit file:

```         
#!/bin/bash

# Maximum file size (in bytes)
max_file_size=104857600

# Find all files larger than max_file_size and add them to the .gitignore file
find . -type f -size +$max_file_sizec -exec echo "{}" >> .gitignore \;
```

This code sets the max_file_size variable to 100 MB and then uses the find command to locate all files in the repository that are larger than the specified max_file_size. The exec option of the find command appends the name of each file that matches the criteria to the .gitignore file.

Save the pre-commit file and make it executable by running the following command in Terminal:

```         
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

With these changes, whenever you run a git commit command, Git will first execute the pre-commit hook, which will automatically add any files larger than 100 MB to the .gitignore file. This will prevent Git from tracking these files in the repository going forward.

## ⚠️In the event of a big (\>100MB) commit...

> In the event that you accidentally committed a file \>100MB, you can reset to the last successful git master branch push⚠️**! warning this will overwrite any changes you made after your last successful push !**⚠️...
>
> If you still want to continue, you can un-comment the code and follow [this](#0){style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 11.4pt;"} instruction:
>
> First, update all `origin/<branch>` refs to latest:
>
> ```{bash}
> #git fetch --all
> ```
>
> Backup your current branch (e.g. `master`):
>
> ```{bash}
> #git branch backup-master
> ```
>
> Jump to the latest commit on `origin/master` :
>
> ```{bash}
> #git reset --hard origin/master
> ```

## Running kallisto

[Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) is a software that can be downloaded and unzipped into a `programs` directory outside of the present working directory. In our case, it is already installed on raven (`/home/shared/kallisto/kallisto`), and can be 'checked' by running the `index` command as below:

```{bash, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
/home/shared/kallisto/kallisto index
```

## Step 4. Downloading Reference

```{bash}
# change to work in data directory
cd ../data
# download fna file to data directory
wget --no-check-certificate https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/bu-github/nb-2023/Cgigas/data/rna.fna
```

creating an index

```{bash}
# use absolute path to kallisto program
 /home/shared/kallisto/kallisto \
# create an index and name it (-i) `cgigas_roslin_rna.index`
index -i \
../data/cgigas_roslin_rna.index \
# here is the absolute path to the RNAseq data (fasta files)
/home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/sr320/github/nb-2023/Cgigas/data
```

## Step 5. Download sequence reads

data is located at absolute path `/home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/sr320/github/nb-2023/Cgigas/data`

```{bash}
# make kallisto_01 directory in output directorty
# comment out once directory is made

#cd ../output
#mkdir kallisto_01
```

```{bash}
# replace data location with absolute path above
#find ../data/*fastq.gz \ # take the data

find /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/sr320/github/nb-2023/Cgigas/data \
| xargs basename -s _R1_001.fastq.gz | xargs -I{} /home/shared/kallisto/kallisto \
quant -i ../data/cgigas_roslin_rna.index \
-o ../output/kallisto_01/{} \
-t 40 \
--single -l 100 -s 10 ../data/{}_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

```
