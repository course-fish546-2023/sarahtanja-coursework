This [assignment](https://sr320.github.io/course-fish546-2023/assignments/01-blast.html) is to take set of unknown sequences, and annotate them.

### Step 1. Download Software

Navigate to the [NCBI blast downloads](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/) page, and select the software for your operating system.

We are going to first try to downloaded the [ncbi-blast-2.13.0+-x64-arm-linux.tar.gz](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.13.0+-x64-arm-linux.tar.gz), and we'll do this not by 'clicking' on the file and downloading it locally to your computer, but by downloading it using the `curl -O` bash command and placing it in a new folder we'll create named 'applications' outside of the repository.

> When you start a bash code chunk the present working directory always starts over in the location of the .Rmd file that you are working from

```{bash}
# check present working directory
pwd
# change to outside of repo
cd ../../
# check that you are outside of repo
pwd
# make application directory (will throw an error if already made once, # comment out if this is the case)
# mkdir applications
# switch into applications directory
cd applications
# curl (download from the internet) the NCBI software
curl -O https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.13.0+-x64-macosx.tar.gz
# tar unzip software 
tar -xf ncbi-blast-2.13.0+-x64-macosx.tar.gz
```

```{bash}
~/sarahtanja/applications/ncbi-blast-2.13.0+/bin/blastx -h
```

```{pwd}
cd ../data
curl -O https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz
mv uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz uniprot_sprot_r2023_01.fasta.gz
gunzip -k uniprot_sprot_r2023_01.fasta.gz
ls ../data
```
